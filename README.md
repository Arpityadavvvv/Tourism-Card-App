# Tourism-Card-App
It is basically a project devloped by using react so it is very basic , having some tour cards and they get removed on tapping specific button , although i learned a lot about react with this project implementation 


card.js and Tours.js are inside component folder and component folder is in the  src folder with App.js , Data.js , Index.css , Index.js

FLOW OF PROGRAM STARTS with 
1) Index.js renders root element in created elent APP.js and filter after mandatory steps
2) Now in this App we will use Tours as a component which contain heading and that card section , we use here MAP function method for optimization **IMP
3) Now in Tours component we use a component called card which coantains a format of card an img,heaidng or anyhting
4) Now we have a data which is array of objects .
5) we use usestates here for readmore/less , for tours array .
6) onclicks plays a very crucil role here
7) understand the one main thing , about components to componets in that PROPS is very important try to understand it 2-3 types
